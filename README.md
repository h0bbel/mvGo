## üéâ Features

- Monitors a folder for new files  
- Full **filename pattern matching** (`*` and `?`)  
- Configurable destinations for matched files  
- Duplicate file handling with configurable directory  
- Maintains a **state file** for already processed files  
- Logs to **console**, **local log file**, and optionally **remote syslog**

  }
}
```

- `watch_dir`: Folder to monitor  
- `poll_interval`: Seconds between scans  
- `state_file`: Persist processed files  
- `log_file`: Local log  
- `duplicate_dir`: Where already processed files go  
- `syslog`: Optional remote logging

sc start mvGo
```

#### NSSM

- Download [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/)  
- Install service pointing to `mvGo.exe` and working directory

## üìä Logging

- Console output  
- Local log file: `mvGo.log`  
- Remote syslog (optional)  
- **Duplicate files** logged with actual path moved to  
- **Supports paths with spaces** in filenames and destination folders  

---

## üß© Workflow

1. Add a file to the watch directory  
2. `mvGo` checks rules  
3. Moves file to destination and updates state  
4. Logs moved files  
5. Files already processed ‚Üí moved to `duplicate_dir` and logged  
6. Files with no matching rule ‚Üí logged
